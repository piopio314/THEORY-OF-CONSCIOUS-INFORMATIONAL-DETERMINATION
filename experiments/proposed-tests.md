## Experiment 1: Test of non-local information correlations in neural networks

### Experiment Objective
Verification of the hypothesis that biological neural systems can exhibit non-local information correlations consistent with predictions of holographic consciousness projection from higher dimensions.

### Testable Hypothesis
**H₀**: Isolated neural cultures do not show statistically significant correlations of EEG signals under conditions of no physical connection.  
**H₁**: Neural cultures exhibit non-local correlations of EEG signals (p < 0.05) measured by Pearson correlation coefficient for frequency bands 1-40 Hz.

### Methodology (5 steps)

1. **Culture preparation**
   - Using 6 mature neural cultures from rat visual cortex (DIV 14-21)
   - Placing cultures in isolated Faraday chambers (distance > 2m)
   - Stabilizing culture conditions for 24h before measurement

2. **Signal recording**
   - Installing microelectrode arrays (MEA) in each culture
   - Simultaneous recording of activity for 60 minutes with 1000 Hz sampling rate
   - Temperature control (37°C) and CO₂ (5%) throughout the experiment

3. **Synchronization and control**
   - Using common clock signal for all recording systems
   - Control of electromagnetic environment (EMG background measurement)
   - Random introduction of light stimulus (LED, 470 nm) as external trigger

4. **Data analysis**
   - Signal filtering (1-40 Hz Butterworth 4th order)
   - Calculation of cross-correlation function for each pair of cultures
   - Coherence analysis in bands: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), gamma (30-40 Hz)

5. **Statistical validation**
   - Comparison with control data (dead cultures/fake signals)
   - Permutation tests (1000 permutations) for assessing correlation significance
   - Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons

### Equipment

| Device | Model | Estimated Cost |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| MEA System | Multi Channel Systems MEA2100 | $8,000 |
| Amplifiers | Intan RHD2000 | $2,000 |
| Faraday Chambers | Custom-made | $500 |
| Software | MATLAB + Signal Processing Toolbox | $1,000 |
| **Total Sum** | | **$11,500** |

*Note: Cost can be reduced to $8,500 by using open-source software (Python + MNE) and equipment rental.*

### Variables

**Independent variables:**
- Distance between cultures (2-5 m)
- Recording time (0-60 min)
- Presence of external stimulus (yes/no)

**Dependent variables:**
- Pearson correlation coefficient between signals
- Phase coherence in different frequency bands
- Maximum correlation delay (ms)

### Control group
- Neural cultures with inactivated membrane potential (TTX 1 μM)
- Fake random signals with similar statistical parameters
- Measurement under full electromagnetic isolation

### Data analysis

**Basic analysis:**
```python
# Analysis pseudocode
for each pair in cultures:
    correlation = pearsonr(signal1, signal2)
    coherence = calculate_coherence(signal1, signal2, fs=1000)
    significance = permutation_test(signal1, signal2, n_permutations=1000)
```

**Success criteria:**
- At least 3 out of 6 culture pairs show significant correlations (p < 0.05)
- Correlations are not explained by known technical artifacts
- Effect is repeatable in minimum 3 independent experiments

### Limitations

**Potential error sources:**
- Electrical artifacts from power systems
- Mechanical micro-vibrations transmitted through laboratory table
- Temperature fluctuations affecting metabolic activity

**Interpretation limitations:**
- Experiment does not directly prove holographic consciousness projection
- Results may be explained by unknown physical mechanisms
- Scale of effect may be too small for practical applications

**What the experiment CANNOT show:**
- Direction of information flow (causality)
- Mechanism of holographic projection
- Connection with higher dimensions
- Scale of effect in systems more complex than neural cultures

### Implementation schedule

| Week | Activity |
|---------|----------|
| 1-2 | Culture preparation and equipment calibration |
| 3-4 | First measurements and procedure optimization |
| 5-8 | Full experimental series (n=6) |
| 9-10 | Data analysis and result validation |
| 11-12 | Experiment repetition and final analysis

### Ethical guidelines
- Neural cultures come from legal sources (tissue banks)
- Experiment ends after 60 minutes of recording
- Cultures are disposed according to biosafety guidelines
- No intervention in live animals - only in vitro cultures
