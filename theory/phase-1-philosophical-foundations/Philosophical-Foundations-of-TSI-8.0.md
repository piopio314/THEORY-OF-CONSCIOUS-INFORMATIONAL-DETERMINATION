## Introduction: The Fundamental Question of Consciousness {#introduction}

### What is consciousness in the context of information?

The question of the nature of consciousness remains one of the deepest and most difficult problems in the philosophy of mind. Traditional approaches—from Cartesian dualism to contemporary reductive materialism—encounter fundamental difficulties in explaining how subjective experience (qualia) can emerge from physical processes, or how it can exist independently of matter.

The Theory of Consciousness as Interface (TSI) 8.0 proposes a novel approach: consciousness is neither a purely physical process nor a non-material substance, but rather **an informational interface** between dimensions of reality. This concept shifts the focus from the question "what is consciousness made of?" to the question "what does consciousness **do** as an informational structure?"

### Paradigmatic Shift

Traditional theories assume that consciousness must be localized in one dimension of reality—physical (materialism), mental (idealism), or as a separate substance (dualism). TSI 8.0 proposes that consciousness **is not localized** in any dimension, but rather **functions as a dynamic interface** enabling the flow of information between dimensions.

This concept resolves the fundamental problem: **consciousness is not a "thing," but a "relation"**—a specific organization of information that enables coherence of experience across different levels of reality.

## Ontological Justification of Dimensional Interface {#ontological-justification}

### Ontological foundation: information as fundamental being

TSI 8.0 is based on the premise that **information is more fundamental than matter and mind**. This does not mean idealism in the traditional sense, but rather **fundamental informational neutralism**: both matter and mind are manifestations of information at different levels of organization.

#### Three ontological levels:

1. **Physical level (P)**: Manifestation of information in physical structures
2. **Mental level (M)**: Manifestation of information in conscious structures
3. **Interface level (I)**: Dynamic informational structure enabling coherence between P and M

### Holographic nature of the interface

The consciousness interface operates on the principle of **holographic reconstruction**: every fragment of information contains the whole, but with limited resolution. This explains why consciousness can be both localized (in the brain) and non-local (experience of unity).

**Key property**: the interface does not **transform** information from one dimension to another, but rather **creates conditions of possibility** for coherent experience. This is the difference between **reduction** and **conditional emergence**.

### Solving the mind-body problem

The traditional mind-body problem arises from the mistaken assumption that mind and body are separate substances or properties. TSI proposes:

> **Mind and body are not separate entities, but different aspects of the same information, revealed through different "windows" of the consciousness interface.**

This approach eliminates the need for:
- **interaction** between substances (problem of psychophysical causation)
- **emergence** of consciousness from matter (hard problem)
- **reduction** of mind to matter (explanatory gap problem)

## Critical Analysis of Dominant Theories of Consciousness {#critical-analysis}

### 1. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) - Giulio Tononi

**Strengths of IIT:**
- Correctly identifies consciousness with information
- Explains unity of experience through integration
- Provides mathematical measures (Φ)

**Fundamental limitations:**
- **Problem of localization**: IIT assumes consciousness is localized in physical systems with high Φ
- **Problem of scale**: Difficulty in explaining why Φ has ontological significance
- **Problem of functionality**: Lack of explanation for **why** information integration leads to experience

**TSI critique**: IIT correctly identifies the **correlation** between information integration and consciousness, but mistakenly assumes that this correlation implies **identity**. TSI proposes that high Φ is a **necessary** but not **sufficient** condition for consciousness—it is a measure of **interface capacity**, not consciousness itself.

### 2. Global Workspace Theory (GWT) - Bernard Baars, Stanislas Dehaene

**Strengths of GWT:**
- Explains global availability of information
- Supported by neurological evidence
- Integrates attention and consciousness

**Fundamental limitations:**
- **Problem of availability vs experience**: Global availability ≠ subjective experience
- **Problem of functionalism**: Reduces consciousness to informational functions
- **Problem of first-person perspective**: Lack of explanation for first-person perspective

**TSI critique**: GWT correctly identifies the **mechanism** of information distribution, but mistakenly identifies this mechanism with **consciousness**. Global access to information is a **function** of the interface, not the **interface itself**.

### 3. Orch-OR (Orchestrated Objective Reduction) - Penrose & Hameroff

**Strengths of Orch-OR:**
- Explains non-local properties of consciousness
- Connects quantum physics with experience
- Explains unity of experience

**Fundamental limitations:**
- **Problem of quantum scale**: Difficulty in maintaining quantum coherence in the warm brain
- **Problem of reduction**: Lack of explanation for how wave function collapse leads to experience
- **Problem of specification**: Lack of clear mechanism for mapping quantum states to qualia

**TSI critique**: Orch-OR correctly identifies **non-local** properties of consciousness, but mistakenly seeks a **physical substrate** for these properties. TSI proposes that non-locality is a **property of the interface**, not a physical state.

### Common critique of traditional theories

All analyzed theories commit a **category error**: they seek a **substantial** nature of consciousness (process, property, or substance), instead of a **relational** nature. TSI proposes a shift from the question "What **is** consciousness?" to the question "What does consciousness **do** as an interface?"

## Philosophical Consequences of Informational Determinism {#deterministic-consequences}

### Informational determinism: a new perspective

TSI 8.0 leads to the concept of **informational determinism**: future states of the system are fully determined by **informational structure**, not by physical causation in the traditional sense.

#### Difference between physical and informational determinism:

- **Physical determinism**: State S(t+1) is determined by physical laws from state S(t)
- **Informational determinism**: Experience D(t+1) is determined by the informational structure of the interface, which **correlates** physical and mental states

### Free will in the context of interface

The traditional problem of free will arises from the mistaken assumption that freedom requires **causal independence** from physics. TSI proposes a new concept:

> **Free will is the ability of the interface to reconstruct informational structure autonomously**

#### Three levels of autonomy:

1. **Level P autonomy**: Physical determinism (no free will)
2. **Level M autonomy**: Freedom as mental coherence
3. **Level I autonomy**: Freedom as **ability to reconstruct** informational structure

### Personal responsibility

Informational determinism **does not eliminate** personal responsibility, but rather **shifts its foundation** from causation to **informational coherence**:

- **Responsibility** = ability to maintain coherent informational structure between intentions and actions
- **Guilt** = informational dissonance between declared values and action structure
- **Rehabilitation** = reconstruction of interface informational structure

### Consequences for ethics and law

TSI leads to **informational ethics**, whose fundamental value is **informational integrity**—coherence between different levels of information (intentions, actions, consequences).

## Responses to Philosophical Objections {#responses-to-objections}

### Objection 1: "This is just a new form of epiphenomenalism"

**Objection**: The consciousness interface may be epiphenomenal—having informational influence but no causal influence.

**Response**: Epiphenomenalism assumes a **unidirectional** relationship (physical → mental). TSI proposes a **cyclic** informational relationship:

- Physical structure **conditions** interface structure
- Interface structure **conditions** mental information availability
- Mental structure **conditions** future physical states through action

**Key difference**: In TSI there is no **ontological priority**—all levels are equally fundamental.

### Objection 2: "The hard problem of facts remains unsolved"

**Objection**: Even if consciousness is an interface, the problem of **hard facts** (Chalmers) remains—why is a specific informational structure associated with specific experience.

**Response**: The hard facts problem assumes that the **relationship** between physical structure and experience must be **contingent**. TSI proposes that the relationship is **necessary** in the informational sense:

> **Experience is not "added" to informational structure—it is the **way of being** of that structure from the interface perspective**

**Analogy**: Shape is not "added" to a mathematical pattern—it is a **consequence** of the pattern's structure.

### Objection 3: "This is hidden dualism"

**Objection**: The distinction between levels P, M, and I is a form of dualism (or trialism).

**Response**: Dualism assumes **ontological difference** of substances. TSI proposes **ontological unity** with **epistemological diversity**:

- All levels are **manifestations** of the same information
- Differences are **perspectival**, not **substantial**
- The interface is not a **separate substance**, but a **way of organizing** information

**Key metaphor**: Waves and particles are not separate entities—they are different **descriptions** of the same phenomenon.

### Objection 4: "Does not explain the unity of consciousness"

**Objection**: Even if consciousness is an interface, the problem of **unity** of experience remains.

**Response**: The unity of consciousness does not require **substantial** unity, but **functional** coherence:

> **Unity of consciousness = informational coherence between all levels of the interface**

**Mechanism**: The interface creates **virtual unity** through continuous reconstruction of informational structure, similar to how a video stream creates **illusion of continuity** from discrete frames.

### Objection 5: "Does not solve the zombie problem"

**Objection**: The possibility remains of **philosophical zombies**—physically identical beings lacking experience.

**Response**: The zombie problem assumes that **physical structure** can exist without **informational structure**. TSI proposes this is **impossible**:

> **Physical structure without informational structure is an abstraction—like shape without size**

**Argument**: Zombies are not **logically possible**, because informational structure is a **necessary condition** for physical structure (and vice versa).

## Summary

The Theory of Consciousness as Interface 8.0 presents an innovative approach to one of the most difficult problems in the philosophy of mind. By shifting the focus from the question of the **substance** of consciousness to the question of its **informational function**, TSI:

1. **Solves** the classic mind-body problem by showing that mind and body are different aspects of the same information
2. **Integrates** the best elements of existing theories (information integration, global access, non-locality)
3. **Preserves** our intuitions about free will and personal responsibility
4. **Responds** to major philosophical objections through paradigmatic shift

The key innovation of TSI is recognizing that consciousness is not a **being**, but a **relation**—a dynamic interface that enables coherence of experience between different dimensions of reality. This approach opens new perspectives both for the philosophy of mind and for practical applications in ethics, law, and technology.
